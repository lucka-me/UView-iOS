    Record the UV Index of iOS Health from weather data.
</p>

## Descriptions
I've paid much attention to the Health app since I'm collection addicted, I want to fill the UV Index with the weather data from website, but there is no app in the App Store could do it, so I made it.

The app is my third iOS app, and I learned many things about location management, delegating, featching data from web, decoding JSON, usage of HealthKit and Background Fetch. The app is functional but buggy, the code is messy but the experience was great.
